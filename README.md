# CS-470---Final-Project
Designed a 2D-Dungeon-Crawler as a Final Project for CS 470 - Game Development.
Worked with a team of six programmers wth 4 weeks to complete a game.

We built off a basic Unity Tutorial and added new features like:
- Procedural Generation
- Optimized A.I.
- Multiple Levels
- Boss Levels
- Inventory
- New Sprites and Backgrounds
- Music
- Main Menu
- Basic RNG Loot System
- New Enemy Types

Credits go to Unity and Matthew-Schell for the wonderful Unity Tutorial.
